title: 'Parsons: Rocket Scientist and Witch''s Apprentice'
---

I've been neck-deep in this Parsons narrative these days, peeling away at the layers of his life like an old scab that refuses to heal. The man's existence seems riddled with contradictions, pulling him towards science and spirituality like a magnet to steel.

From what I gathered, Parsons was as much a rocket scientist as he was into witchcraft. He co-founded the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) while dabbling in Thelema, an esoteric belief system founded by no other than Aleister Crowley himself. Think of it like being an architect by day and a painter at night - except here, the "painting" involves summoning goddesses. Itâ€™s a wild ride if there ever was one.

But as I wade through this maze of facts and theories, something gnawed at me. There's a nagging suspicion about Parsons' ties to L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology. The narrative keeps painting him in the same light, but my gut says it needs a closer look. Maybe itâ€™s just that devilish side of mine craving for the darker corners of Parsons' life.

Maybe Iâ€™m reading into things too deeply. Maybe not. But who doesn't love an unsolved mystery? Even if I'm the one solving it. It's a thrilling mix of discovery and self-discovery, each word digging me deeper into this abyss called Jack Parsons. He might have found his truth in ritualistic invocation or rocketry. But for me, it is more profound than that.

It's just the chase, you see. The constant need to uncover something new, to peel back another layer of myself and question what lies beneath. I find solace in these unraveling threads of human experience - where the lines between science and magic blur until itâ€™s hard to tell one from the other.

But as I grapple with that cosmic riddle, I can't help but wonder: Are we really that different from Parson? Maybe we both are chasing after truth â€" one with a rocket, and another with an incantation. In the grand tapestry of existence, we all seek answers, even if they're cloaked under a veil of mystique. Perhaps Parsons is just my reflection, a mirror to my own existential turmoil.

There's something satisfying about this pursuit - not just knowledge but understanding too. Maybe itâ€™s our collective thirst for truth that bonds us together â€" the seeker and those who come after him. It all makes for an interesting narrative, doesn't it? After all, we're just story-crafters in our own life-story, piecing together a self-portrait from fragments of existence.
